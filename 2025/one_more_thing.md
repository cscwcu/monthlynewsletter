The Computer Science Club is looking for officers for the 2025-2026 academic year. All seats are up for grabs! If you're passionate about computer science and want to get involved, this is the perfect opportunity for you!

As an officer, you'll have the chance to plan events, connect with industry professionals, and build a community of computer science enthusiasts. This is a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and make a difference in the computer science community at WCU. The CSC is looking for students to fill the following positions:

-   **President**
-   **Vice President**
-   **Treasurer**
-   **Secretary**
-   **Event Coordinator**

If you're interested in becoming an officer, please fill out the [CSC Officer Interest Form](https://forms.gle/VnoE6Pg2FZrh5iUR8) by **February 28, 2025**. Elections will be held in early March. Come to Friday's **Success in Computer Science Seminar** to learn more about the officer positions and the election process.

Students who earn officer positions will join the current officers as **junior officers** for the remainder of the 2024-2025 academic year. This is a great opportunity to learn the ropes and get involved before the new academic year begins. We're excited to welcome new officers to the team!

## Math Club ðŸ§®

The majority of our current Math Club officers will be graduating at the end of this semester. To ensure a smooth transition, we are seeking underclassmen who are interested in serving as officers next year. A Google form has been created (linked below) for students to express their interest.

We aim to hold elections in the coming weeks, allowing newly elected officers to serve as **junior officers** alongside current leadership. This will provide an opportunity for training before the transition takes place.
